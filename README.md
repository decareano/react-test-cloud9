Based on this tutorial (https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react), I decided to redo parts of it from scratch. 
Mainly the following sections:
1. Props
2. State
3. Forms 

All in a SPA for now.
The app has been configured and successfully connected to a "Realtime Database" in firebase in the backend.

Next: Authentication plus routing
